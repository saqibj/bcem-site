Proud Moment for BCEM!🎉

We are proud to announce that our Managing Director Investments, Talha Ameer Khan, CFA, is now an official Network Partner of Renewables First, a dynamic platform dedicated to accelerating solar adoption.

The conference was attended by our CEO Nabeel Malik along with Talha Ameer Khan, CFA and Rajah Mishaz Khan. The study provided a deep understanding of the underserved segment of SMEs and households for green financing.

At BCEM, we are committed to driving the transition towards a low-carbon, sustainable future, and being part of this initiative further strengthens our mission to make clean energy accessible to all.

Here’s to fostering innovation, collaboration, and a greener tomorrow.
