⚡ Shaping the Future of Pakistan’s Power Market — Starting Today in Karachi!

Burj Clean Energy is proud to stand among the sponsors of the Multi-Stakeholder Conference on Competitive Electricity Market in Pakistan, hosted by Renewables First and Pakistan Business Forum, in collaboration with the Private Power & Infrastructure Board (PPIB).

This landmark gathering brings policy makers, regulators, industry leaders, innovators, and investors together under one roof to accelerate the Competitive Trading Bilateral Contracts Market (CTBCM) — a crucial step toward transforming Pakistan’s electricity landscape.

For us at Burj Clean Energy, this is more than sponsorship — it’s a commitment to powering a cleaner, smarter, and more sustainable energy future for Pakistan. 🌱💡
